                        <h2>What Am I Looking For?</h2>
                        <p>Currently, I'm looking for CO-OP opportunities for Summer-Fall 2021 and Spring-Summer 2022.
                        I want industry experience as a student to better understand how my engineering knowledge from school 
                        is applied in the real world; this will help me maximize my education and experiences during my last year of 
                        college for industry. In general, I'm a quick, inquisitive learner who enjoys challenges, so
                        I'm willing to take on whatever experiences I can to grow. I enjoy learning and pushing my limits, so any 
                        opportunity to learn and to get my foot in the door is appreciated. If you know of any companies I should apply 
                        to or anyone I should contact, please don't hesitate to email me or reach out to me via LinkedIn!</p>

                        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

                        <h3>Summer 2019 - Digital Federal Credit Union</h3>
                        <p>Position: Intern, Call Center Information Services Specialist</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I spoke to members of the financial institution, assisting them with accessing their
                        account, understanding loans and making payments, weighing different options to optimize their finances,
                        understanding fees, and redirecting them to more specialized teams when needed. I worked with a team to
                        achieve goals for the company and was the leading teammate for one of our two goals.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Speaking and Verbal Communication Skills - Since the entire job required us to
                        communicate with members purely verbally, I quickly honed my verbal communication skills to be more
                        clear and concise to more smoothly communicate with the members on the phone. As a part of that, I
                        acquired the skills of understanding members' feelings or intentions through their voices rather than
                        their words, which allowed me to tailor my speaking style to most effectively help the member.
                        (2) Professionalism - Working in an office environment for the first time, I learned how to interact
                        and behave appropriately with my colleagues and bosses to make good professional relations with
                        everyone I worked with while being a positive presence in the company. </p>

                        <h3>Fall 2018-Spring 2019 - Graspable Math Research Team at WPI</h3>
                        <p>Position: Intern</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I assisted the research team with various different tasks, starting out with helping
                        them design a study and analyze the data, testing the software/platforms to be used prior to the study
                        being conducted, and at the end, beginning the website and database to be used for a future study.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Teamwork - In order to achieve the research team goals, we had to work as a
                        team and within subteams to optimize our time and efficiency. Because the research team also consisted
                        of undergraduate and graduate students, it was important for us to accommodate changes in availability
                        and prioritize our commitments as students. Juggling both and working together to make sure everyone
                        did their work and wasn't overly stressed taught me a lot about both research as an undergraduate as well
                        as teamwork and the importance of bringing compassion and understanding into the way we work with each
                        other. (2) Python and SQL - In my last task of building the website and database for the upcoming study,
                        I gained experience in Python, which I had used before, and SQL, which was a database I had no experience
                        with prior to this project. Although I didn't gain extensive experience with either because my internship
                        ended in the middle of the project, I learned how to acquire skills and research to implement something
                        completely new to me in a short period of time.</p>

                        <h3>Fall 2015-Spring 2019 - Pi Math and Private Tutoring</h3>
                        <p>Position: Tutor</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I tutored students from grades 1-9 in mathematics. The first two years, I worked
                        at Pi Math as both a private and classroom tutor, tutoring students in grades 1-6. After taking a break
                        during junior year, I tutored privately during my last year of high school. During this time, I tutored
                        a 6th grade student and a 9th grade Algebra Honors student on a weekly basis.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) People Skills - Part of being a teacher/tutor is being able to talk with both
                        the students as well as their parents. Especially as a private tutor, I had to know how to sell myself
                        and communicate effectively and regularly to maintain strong relations with the student and their parents.
                        (2) Clear Communication Skills - Having to explain concepts to students with varying capabilities and
                        grasps on mathematics made me learn how to take a single topic and explain it in numerous ways. Furthermore,
                        it taught me how to gauge a students' understanding and confusion points quickly in order to most effectively
                        explain a concept to them. This assisted me greatly in my job at DCU in 2019 because I had the explanation
                        skills under my belt, so I was able to hone those skills more during that internship. </p>

                        <h3>Summer 2018 - MIT Lincoln Laboratory Radar Introduction for Student Engineers</h3>
                        <p>Position: Student Program Intern</p>
                        <p>Program Description: Students were challenged to build a Doppler and range radar by using creative
                        problem-solving strategies. This hands-on program allowed us to work in a state-of-the-art laboratory with
                        highly talented scientists and engineers at the Lincoln Laboratory. The program also exposed us to current
                        research happening and the variety of applications of engineering in the real world.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Presentation Skills - At the end of the program, we were required to present one of
                        the topics covered in our Radar Introduction lectures and explain how it was implemented in the radars we had
                        built ourselves. Presenting to a group of highly knowledgeable engineers and other MIT and Lincoln Laboratory
                        staff was stressful because it was my first time presenting in a professional atmosphere. With the guidance
                        of our mentors, we were taught the proper etiquette and presentation skills to prepare us before we presented
                        in front of industry professionals. (2) Soldering, Circuitry - Although a technical skill, this is an
                        important skill I learned at this program. It was essential in building the radar and integrating it with the
                        sensors and data recording tools used.</p>

                        <h3>Summer 2018 - NASA Aerospace Engineering Introduction Program at WPI</h3>
                        <p>Position: Student Program Intern</p>
                        <p>Program Description: Introduced students to aerospace engineering. The program consisted of four
                        week-long modules that exposed us to an individual part of aerospace engineering. Working in Matlab
                        and Solidworks, we gained experience in Vehicle Dynamics, Propulsion, UAV Controls, and Materials. The second
                        half of each day was spent giving us more broad insight into the aerospace industry and the physics explaining
                        how planes and rockets fly. This was the program that inspired me to go into aerospace engineering, and the
                        decision was further enforced at the MIT program after talking to aerospace engineers at the Lincoln Lab.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Quick Learning - Because vehicle dynamics relies on calculus, which was new to a majority
                        of program inductees, we had to learn and understand the basics quickly in order to cover the required material.
                        As a quick learner, this pushed even my own learning skills, and after an intensive four weeks of learning, I
                        am a significantly more efficient learner and have more confidence in my abilities to learn quickly in order to
                        accomplish a certain goal or learn something new.</p>

                        <p>Position: Soror</p>
                        <p>Role Description: As a member of the sisterhood, I help create a strong network of women who look to build
                        themselves personally and professionally across various different fields.</p>

                        <h3>Fall 2019 - Longhorn Rocketry Association</h3>
                        <p>Position: Deployment Team Member</p>
                        <p>Role Description: I helped to design the deployment system for the rocket that will be
                        competing in the NASA Student Launch Initiative. The deployment system is for the drone that
                        resides within the body tube of our rocket; after our rocket lands, the drone must be released
                        to complete the second part of our mission. Although part of the team for only a semester, I
                        researched and chose the materials and components that will be used to build the system and
                        contributed to the design of it as well. </p>

                        <p>Position: Controls Team Member</p>
                        <p>Role Description: I helped in the flight path planning component of the team, where we worked
                        on determining the flight path of the drone for the upcoming International Aerial Robotics
                        Competition. This consisted of figuring out optimal curvature of the path and how to form the
                        most efficient path to minimize flight time and optimize battery life. </p>
