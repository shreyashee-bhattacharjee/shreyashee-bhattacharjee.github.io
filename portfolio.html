                        <h3>Feb 2020-Current - NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Range and Mission Management Office</h3>
                        <p>Position: Pathways Intern, Project Management</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I work as a Project Manager and Assistant Project Manager for a variety of
                        different projects, including a pre-phase A radar project, sounding rocket missions, and Expendable
                        Launch Vehicle (ELV) missions.
                        <br>Currently, I manage the Wallops Incoherent Scatter Radar Concept and Design
                        Study, which we are working on in collaboration with NSF, MIT Haystack, and a university professor
                        to run simulations for an ISR on Wallops Island and to conduct a workshop to build a science case
                        for this asset to come to reality.
                        <br>I am also currently the Assistant Project Manager for the High-Operational
                        Tempo for Hypersonics Operation. I have been working with the Project Manager since the requirements phase
                        and in these past 3 months, I have organized site visits (including developing the COVID-19 approval packages
                        and getting security approval for badges), conducted one site visit, and am responsible for a number of
                        the project document deliverables. As the Assistant Project Manager, I have also stepped in a number of times
                        as Project Manager, including running meetings and subbing in as the Project Manager on a site visit.
                        <br>In the past, I worked as an Assistant Project Manager for the KiNET-X mission, which launched in May.
                        In my capacity as Asst. PM, I was primarily responsible for documentation and for accompanying
                        the Project Manager on site surveys during launch operations. For all launch attempts and on day-of-launch,
                        I was sitting beside the PM and Deputy PM in the control center.
                        <br>I also worked as the Assistant Project Manager for the Minotaur L-111 mission, which launched in June.
                        In that role, I ran a couple meetings with the team leads, helped develop some of the documentation, and,
                        primarily, was responsible for the project schedule and overall project tracking (eg. action items, review
                        dates, test events, document deadlines, etc). </p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Organization - Working as a project manager for fast-paced launch operations
                        projects, particularly on the L-111 ELV Mission, challenged me to step up and develop an organizational
                        system to help the entire team stay on the same page and track the many action items and tasks that
                        popped up daily. (2) Confidence - Working alongside and managing colleagues with decades more experience
                        than me was incredibly daunting in the beginning, particularly given that I had never worked in the industry
                        directly before. However, managing projects and teams, and having to actually be a leader within those teams,
                        really pushed me to develop my confidence in myself and my abilities to take on new challenges, tasks, and
                        opportunities. (3) Project Management - Along with my on-the-job training, I also took two formal training
                        courses to help develop my knowledge: (1) Project Management and Systems Engineering and (2) Project Planning,
                        Analysis, and Control. Through these courses, I learned a lot of PM concepts and applications and got hands-on
                        learning experience as the Scrum Master for our 2-week course project, in which we went through a Phase A simulation
                        for the famous FireSAT program and developed level 1-3 requirements, a WBS, estimated costs, and a high-level architecture
                        while working to integrate our individual project with the other projects in the program. </p>
                        
                        <h3>Summer 2020 - MIT Lincoln Laboratory</h3>
                        <p>Position: Teaching Assistant, LLRISE</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I mentored 11th grade students, helping them troubleshoot their radar, use their radar to conduct
                        experiments, and complete homework assignments. In my student group, my TA partner and I emphasized collaboration
                        and the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. Through this, we encouraged students to learn
                        independently and work through challenges, with the intention to help prepare them for college and a bright future ahead. </p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Leaderhip Skills - I mentored and taught students in the program, all of whom
                        were barely two years younger than me; due to the minimal age difference, combined with the fully-remote
                        style of the program, I placed importance on establishing and maintaining a leader presence from the
                        very beginning, a skill I learned from tutoring and built on here. </p>


                        <h3>Summer 2019 - Digital Federal Credit Union</h3>
                        <p>Position: Intern, Call Center Information Services Specialist</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I spoke to members of the financial institution, assisting them with accessing their
                        account, understanding loans and making payments, weighing different options to optimize their finances,
                        understanding fees, and redirecting them to more specialized teams when needed. I worked with a team to
                        achieve goals for the company and was the leading teammate for one of our two goals.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Speaking and Verbal Communication Skills - The job solely relied on my ability to
                        communicate with members purely verbally, so I quickly developed clearer and more concise verbal communication skills
                        more smoothly communicate with members on the phone. As a part of that, I acquired the skill of understanding members'
                        feelings or intentions through their voices rather than their words, which allowed me to tailor my speaking style to
                        most effectively help the member.
                        (2) Professionalism - As my first time in a professional work environment, I learned how to interact
                        and behave appropriately with my colleagues and bosses to make valuable professional relations and be
                        a positive presence in the company. </p>

                        <h3>Fall 2018-Spring 2019 - Graspable Math Research Team at WPI</h3>
                        <p>Position: Intern</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I assisted the research team in various capacities throughout the year. Initially, I helped
                        to design a study and analyze the data. After, I worked with the team to test the software/platforms that were going to be
                        used for the study. At the end, I began the software development for the website and database to be used for a future study.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Teamwork - The research team consisted of both undergraduate and graduate students, so everyone had
                        to be flexible to work around each other's commitments and communicate often to ensure work was completed on time without
                        over-stressing any team members. From this, I learned the importance of communication and bringing compassion and
                        understanding into the team dynamics. (2) Python and SQL - While developing the website and database for the upcoming study,
                        I gained more experience in Python and was introduced to SQL, which I had no experience with prior to this project. My internship
                        ended mid-project, so while I didn't gain extensive experience with either, I learned how to acquire skills and research to implement
                        something completely new to me in an accelerated timeframe.</p>

                        <h3>Fall 2015-Spring 2019 - Pi Math and Private Tutoring</h3>
                        <p>Position: Tutor</p>
                        <p>Job Description: I tutored students from grades 1-9 in mathematics. The first two years, I worked
                        at Pi Math as both a private and classroom tutor, tutoring students in grades 1-6. After a year-long hiaturs,
                        I started tutoring again privately during my last year of high school. During this time, I tutored
                        a 6th grade student and a 9th grade Algebra Honors student on a weekly basis.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) People Skills - Part of being a teacher/tutor is being able to talk with both
                        the students as well as their parents. Especially as a private tutor, I had to know how to sell myself
                        and communicate effectively and regularly to maintain strong relations with the student and their parents.
                        (2) Clear Communication Skills - Having to explain concepts to students with varying capabilities and
                        grasps on mathematical topics made me learn how to take a single topic and explain it in numerous ways. Furthermore,
                        it taught me how to gauge a students' understanding and confusion points quickly in order to most effectively
                        explain a concept to them. This assisted me greatly in my job at DCU in 2019 because I had the explanation
                        skills under my belt, so I was able to hone those skills more during that internship. </p>

                        <h3>Summer 2018 - MIT Lincoln Laboratory Radar Introduction for Student Engineers</h3>
                        <p>Position: Student Program Intern</p>
                        <p>Program Description: I built a Doppler and range radar with the help of mentors and by adopting creative
                        problem-solving strategies. This hands-on program allowed me to work in a state-of-the-art laboratory with
                        highly talented scientists and engineers at the Lincoln Laboratory to develop our radars, and I also had the
                        opportunity to participate in lectures presented by various MITLL scientists and engineers working with radar
                        technology. At the conclusion of the program, we were required to present one of the topics covered in our
                        Radar Introduction lectures and explain how it was implemented in the radars we had built ourselves.
                        Our audience consisted of a group of highly knowledgeable engineers and other MIT and Lincoln Laboratory.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Presentation Skills - The final presentation was my first time presenting in a
                        professional atmosphere. With the guidance of our mentors, I was prepared with the proper etiquette and
                        presentation skills for a successful presentation directed to industry professionals. (2) Soldering,
                        Circuitry - Having never soldered or worked with circuitry before, this was an essential skill I developed while
                        building the radar hardware and integrating it with the sensors and data recording tools used.</p>

                        <h3>Summer 2018 - NASA Aerospace Engineering Introduction Program at WPI</h3>
                        <p>Position: Student Program Intern</p>
                        <p>Program Description: I was introduced to an overview of aerospace engineering. The program consisted of four
                        week-long modules that exposed us to an individual part of aerospace engineering every week. Working in Matlab
                        and Solidworks, we gained experience in Vehicle Dynamics, Propulsion, UAV Controls, and Materials. The second
                        half of each day was spent giving us more broad insight into the aerospace industry and the physics explaining
                        how planes and rockets fly. This was the program that inspired me to go into aerospace engineering, and the
                        decision was further enforced at the MIT program after talking to aerospace engineers at Lincoln Lab.</p>
                        <p>Skills Acquired: (1) Quick Learning - Because vehicle dynamics relies on calculus, which was entirely new to me,
                        I had to learn and understand the basics quickly in order to cover the required material. Even as a naturally quick
                        learner, I found the learning pace challenging. After an intensive four weeks of learning, I am a significantly more
                        efficient learner and have more confidence in my abilities to pick up and apply new concepts and topics in an
                        accelerated timeframe.</p>

                        <p>Position: Board of Directors, Finance</p>
                        <p>Role Description: As a director, I worked with the board to spearhead the organization to promote
                        diversity, inclusion, and authenticity for women in technology. Our vision was to create an organization
                        where we develop a strong network of women and run weekly events that promote personal, technical, and 
                        social growth. Adapting to COVID, my role as finance director had been improvised. Having entered the
                        organization wanting to make a difference in accessibility to mentorship and guidance for women in tech,
                        I was focused on spearheading the Alumni/Mentorship Network for our organization. My responsibilities also
                        included assisting the Corporate Director to plan our technical events and updating the
                        <a href="https://www.re-sonate.wixsite.com/tech" >website</a>.</p>

                        <p>Position: Program Inductee</p>
                        <p>Program Description: As a member of WIELD Texas, I worked on building a personal brand
                        and acquiring the skills and network to attain management and executive roles.
                        This selective program consists of 25 women who demonstrate potential in leadership and
                        entrepreneurship with a drive that can be fostered to attain executive leadership within the 10 years.
                        Surrounded by a team of accomplished mentors and highly motivated women who are ready to impact the world, I
                        was able to begin a deep, personal journey into self-development and self-growth, allowing me to
                        step into the NASA Pathways Project Management role and to become the confident, strong woman I am now. </p>

                        <p>Position: Active Member</p>
                        <p>Role Description: In Spring 2020, I was part of the Leadership Shadow Program and shadowed
                        the core SWE team. While running for VP, I helped come up with ideas for building up the UT SWE alumni 
                        network. After accepting my position at Re-Sonate, I decided to remain an active member of SWE rather 
                        than join the leadership team.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Spring 2020-Spring 2021 - Kappa Phi Gamma Sorority Inc</h3>
                        <p>Position: Soror</p>
                        <p>Role Description: As a member of the sisterhood, I helped create a strong network of women who look to build
                        themselves personally and professionally across various different fields.</p>

                        <h3>Fall 2019 - Longhorn Rocketry Association</h3>
                        <p>Position: Deployment Team Member</p>
                        <p>Role Description: I helped design the deployment system for the rocket that competed in the NASA Student
                        Launch Initiative in 2020. The deployment system was for the drone that resided in a cavity within the body
                        tube of our rocket; after the rocket landed, the drone had to be released to complete the second part of
                        our mission. Although part of the team for only a semester, I researched and chose the materials and
                        components that were used to build the system and contributed to the design of it as well. </p>

                        <h3>Fall 2019 - Texas Aerial Robotics</h3>
                        <p>Position: Controls Team Member</p>
                        <p>Role Description: I helped in the flight path planning component of the team, where we worked
                        on determining the flight path of the drone for the upcoming International Aerial Robotics
                        Competition. I was responsible for figuring out optimal curvature of the path and how to form the
                        most efficient path to minimize flight time and optimize battery life. </p>
