                        <h2>Who am I professionally?</h2>
                        <p>I am an aerospace engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 2023. This year (2021), I am taking a gap year to gain experience at the NASA
                        Wallops Range. I didn't even know Project Management was a career until I applied, but boy, what a wild ride it's been! I've fallen in love with the position and realized
                        I have an aptitude for it too. What I have been interested in since I began college was Space Flight, particularly the designing, drafting, and simulating of rockets and missiles.
                        With a couple rapid-prototyping projects under my belt, I've learned that I love CAD, I love simulations, I love design, and I love marrying my creativity with my technical skills.
                        However, as a natural-born explorer, I'm always looking to try new things and expand on my knowledge of the field. As big-picture as it may seem, my ultimate goal for my career is
                        simply to spread inspiration and positivity to as many people as I can reach, whether that be through the technology that I create or the role I take on, and I'm excited to see
                        the journey of how I get there!</p>
                        <p>As an ENFP with an entrepreneurial streak, I started a YouTube channel and blog during lockdown, which you can check out <a href="https://www.linktr.ee/simplyshreya">here</a>.</p>

                        <span></span>
                        <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
                        <p>I was born in Kolkata, India and moved to the United States when I was one. I've lived in Massachusetts all the way until college, so coming to Texas was a big step for me.
                        As an only child, it was, and is continually, a challenge to live without my parents nearby because they're my whole world. But it's also taught me a lot about myself as
                        an individual and has really opened my eyes to just how important my family is to me and how much they've shaped me into the person I am today. I've had the privilege to
                        have my parents as my best friends, but to also have them to look up to as role models in assimilating into American culture. As immigrants, I've watched them adapt to American
                        society and simultaneously immerse themselves more into Indian culture. They've inspired me through their sacrifice and have taught me the importance of identity and integrity,
                        and they have defined the ambitious, assertive, grounded person I am today. </p>

                <div class="col-10">
                    <div class="about-content mt-100 mb-100 text-center">
                        <span></span>
                        <h2>Who am I personally?</h2>
                        <p>Outside of focusing on building my career and being a student, I am also an actual person (surprise!). For these past 7 months, I have been living alone with a handful
                        of friends (other interns) who were only here temporarily. As a result, I have had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend all day, every day with myself for extended
                        periods of time. While it was initially difficult, this has led to enormous transformation and self-growth that I never imagined possible. I truly believe that, after 20
                        years of living, I have finally found myself.
                        <br>Since Jan 2021, I have been practicing Yoga and pursuing my Yoga Teacher Training. What started out as a spontaneous decision has become an integral part of who I am.
                        While my training has been on and off due to a myriad of reasons, I have been practicing Yoga regularly for almost 9 months now, and implemented the practice of mindfulness
                        and intention throughout my day. Along with Yoga, I also delved deeper into Ayurveda, which I also try to apply as much as possible in my day-to-day life.
                        <br>Unsurprisingly, doing Yoga has impacted me beyond just having a daily practice. At the heart of Yoga is living fully in the present, so as I dove deeper into Yoga, I
                        also began to transform as a human. I'm now a lot more of a happy-go-lucky, live-in-the-moment kind of person, which shows up in a number of little wdays.
                        <br>When @chelseasyoga started a 300-rep challenge 3 months ago, I threw myself off the deep end and joined. When I started, I knew I couldn't even do 200 reps because I
                        hadn't properly worked out in years, but it seemed like a fun and exciting challenge to test my limits. Now, my 300-rep workout is the highlight of every morning.
                        <br>One of the hundreds of times I was scrolling through Instagram, I saw a video of someone shuffle dancing and decided I wanted to learn it because it looked cool. I've
                        always been quite uncoordinated, so seeing their feet move in these insane ways just blew my mind, and I was determined to figure it out. It took too many hours to count,
                        but now, shuffling is one of my most favorite things. Whenever I have a free moment, I'll crank up some fun music and shuffle or free dance around my house until I'm sweating
                        buckets, and then, I'll dance some more! It's great. I
                        <br>There was another time where I saw a video about ice water baths and could not fathom how superhuman someone had to be to willingly put themselves through that... so of
                        course, I decided, why not? I cranked my shower to the coldest temperature possible, in the middle of winter, and just went for it. While the first time was really fricking
                        cold (as is every other time I take cold water showers), I do those daily too. There's an indescribable I-can-conquer-the-world, exhilarating, giddy feeling that comes from
                        being able to control your mind and body as you stand in the absolute freezing cold water.
                        <br>I've also been on more adventures in these past few months than the majority of my life. I've done countless solo trips to the beach to read or walk or simply enjoy the ocean.
                        I've also driven up to DC a few times to explore our nation's capital to meet up with friends or to explore with another intern. And the number of places I've explored in just this
                        past month with another intern is crazy - we spent ~16 hours every day of every weekend outside in a new place, just walking around and seeing everything there is to see. Needless
                        to say, I've explored most every corner of the Eastern Shore by this point. But I've also realized that I fully intend to spend as much time adventuring for the rest of my life.
                        <br>Bottom line is I like to have fun and enjoy life while I'm living it. I used to have a journal that said "Live Truly, Laugh Freely, Love Deeply." While I have always loved
                        that quote, it is only now that I think I truly embody it. This mantra is exemplified when I'm alone dancing around by myself, when I'm hanging out with my friends and family,
                        and in the new relationships I have forged and the old ones I have shed. I love working on myself and pushing my limits to see who I can be in the future, and I can't wait to see
                        where I go and the many incredible memories I make and lessons I learn along the way. Check out my <a href="https://www.linktr.ee/simplyshreya">Instagram and blog</a> if you want
                        to see my journey! I track a lot of it on there:) </p>
