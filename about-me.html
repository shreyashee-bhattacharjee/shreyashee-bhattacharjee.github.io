                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>I'm an aerospace engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin, and I'm graduating in 3 years. 
                        I'm interested in Space Flight, particularly in the designing, drafting, and simulating of rockets and missiles. However, as a natural-born explorer, I'm looking to try
                        new things and expand on my knowledge of the field. My dream is to someday enter startup culture and build my own company, but if not that, I
                        aspire to be a leader in the aerospace world. Either way, I want to create a platform through which I can inspire the next generation and make my impact on the world
                        through the STEM perspective.</p>
                        <p>As an ENFP with an entrepreneurial streak, I started a YouTube channel and blog during lockdown, which you can check out <a href="https://www.linktr.ee/simplyshreya">here</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col-10">
                    <div class="about-content mt-100 mb-100 text-center">
                        <span></span>
                        <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
                        <p>I was born in Kolkata, India and moved to the United States when I was one. I've lived in Massachusetts all the way until college, so coming to Texas was a big step for me.
                        As an only child, it was, and is continually, a challenge to live without my parents nearby because they're my whole world. But it's also taught me a lot about myself as
                        an individual and has really opened my eyes to just how important my family is to me and how much they've shaped me into the person I am today. I've had the privilege to
                        have my parents as my best friends, but to also have them to look up to as role models in assimilating into American culture. As immigrants, I've watched them adapt to American
                        society and simultaneously immerse themselves more into Indian culture. They've inspired me through their sacrifice and have taught me the importance of identity and integrity,
                        and they have defined the ambitious, assertive, grounded person I am today. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col-10">
                    <div class="about-content mt-100 mb-100 text-center">
                        <span></span>
                        <h2>Who am I personally?</h2>
                        <p>Outside of focusing on building my career and being a student, I also am an actual person (surprise!). My senior year, I had to do a 100-hour project for my school, in
                        which I hand-stitched a quilt of numerous shirts I had acquired through school, events, and extracurriculars I've participated in throughout my life. That introduced me to
                        sewing, which I realized I really love. I enjoy making things (which is why I am pursuing an engineering degree), and sewing embodies a creative side that isn't
                        found in building technology. Although I didn't have the time for it during the semester, I went home and sewed my Christmas dress, which was my first time sewing something
                        wearable. After really enjoying that entire process, I hope to someday buy myself a sewing machine so that I can sew my own clothes at home. Otherwise, like anyone else,
                        I spend my time hanging out with my friends. I love playing cards, particularly Fish (aka Literature), and watching movies during my free time to destress and relax a little. </p>
